# ðŸ”Ž Overview: Maverick AMM

The Maverick Protocol is a groundbreaking addition to the decentralized finance landscape, designed to serve as a robust infrastructure for traders, liquidity providers, DAO treasuries, and developers. It is powered by an innovative Automated Market Maker (AMM) that redefines the traditional market-making mechanisms.

At the heart of the Maverick AMM is a feature that enhances capital efficiency by automating the concentration of liquidity in response to price fluctuations. This automation not only optimizes the liquidity available in the market but also ensures superior price points for traders and increased fee earnings for liquidity providers. Moreover, it alleviates the burden of high gas fees that liquidity providers often face when manually adjusting their positions in response to price changes.

In a novel approach, the Maverick Protocol allows liquidity providers to track the price of an asset in one direction, essentially enabling them to speculate on the price trajectory of a specific token. This mechanism is akin to single-sided liquidity strategies where the liquidity provider's exposure is primarily, if not entirely, to a single asset within a pool.

These advancements collectively signify a transformative shift in how smart contracts handle liquidity. Maverick stands as the pioneer of Dynamic Distribution AMMs, automating liquidity strategies that previously necessitated daily management or the deployment of metaprotocols. This innovation heralds a new era of efficiency and convenience in the DeFi space.
