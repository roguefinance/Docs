### **Pre-launch**

_It started on October 2, 2023._

* Deposit your MAV to help bootstrap Rogue's veMAV lock. You can withdraw at anytime until the lock.
* This grants you access to Rogue's Incentive Program: Uprising (details TBA).

### **Launch**&#x20;

_Shortly after Maverick ve-model's stage 2._

&#x20;Rogue will deploy the full protocol:

* [**Rogue's MAV Liquid-Locker**](../../guides/rogue-for-mav-lockers.md)
* [**Rogue's Liquidity Boosters**](../../guides/rogue-for-maverick-amm-lps.md)
* [**Rogue's Vote-Market**](../../guides/vote-market.md)
* [**Rogue's revenue model**](../../guides/platform-fees.md)

### **Incentives and governance**&#x20;

_Shortly after Launch_

Once Rogue has attracted liquidity, we'll ship $ROG, our native token and how it fits in the ecosystem.

### Integration with new yield sources

_It's on the table_

Rogue will integrate with new liquidity sources
