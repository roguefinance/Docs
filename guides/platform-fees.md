# âš¡ Platform fees

Rogue charges a 20% performance fee on **MAV** emissions claimed by LPs and **veMAV** fees generated**.**

#### Repartition of MAV claimed

* 80% goes to **bpLP** stakers: we aim to reward LP stakers for their fair share
* 10% goes to **eROG** holders in **gMAV**: this serves as [revenue share](../tokenomics/incentives/revenue-sharing.md#revenue-share) (50% of platform fees)
* 5% goes to **rMAV** stakers: this rebalances lockers-LPs incentives
* 5% goes to Treasury: used to fund future protocol development

{% hint style="info" %}
_Note: Rogue only charges fees on MAV claimed, not on any extra incentive tokens._
{% endhint %}

#### Repartition of **veMAV** fees generated

* 80% goes to **rMAV** stakers
* 15% goes to **eROG** allocators: serves as [revenue share](../tokenomics/incentives/revenue-sharing.md#revenue-share) (75% of platform fees)
* 5% goes to treasury: to fund future protocol development

There is also a 2% fee charged on [bounties deposits](vote-market.md#introducing-bounty) of both MAV and ROG lockers. It is distributed to the Treasury.
