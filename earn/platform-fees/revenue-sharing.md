# Revenue sharing

#### Revenue share

Rogue redistributes protocol fees to **eROG** allocators. When allocated to our Dividend Module, **eROG** gives access to a share of [performance fee](./) it charges from [bpVaults](../../stake/rogue-for-maverick-amm-lps/bpvaults.md) and [rMAV](../../stake/rogue-for-mav-lockers/rmav.md) holders rewards.

* _10% of all **MAV** claimed by LPs:_ These **MAV** are converted to **rMAV** before distribution to keep increasing the number of locked tokens.
* _15% of all fees claimed by **rMAV** stakers:_ These fees are converted to **ETH**, providing real yield in a well-established and widely-accepted asset.

This mechanism creates demand for **ROG** by making it a ticket to:&#x20;

* **rMAV**: earn voting power over a powerful liquidity mining program.
* **ETH**: earn a widely liquid yield-bearing asset.

(Soon: eROG holders share a portion of [Rogue OLM](../../tokenomics/rog-and-orog.md#option-liquidity-mining) proceeds)

Read about further **eROG** utility in the [next section](../vote-market/).
