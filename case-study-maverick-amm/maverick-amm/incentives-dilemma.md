# Incentives dilemma

#### The Importance of Liquidity in DeFi

Liquidity is the cornerstone of any well-functioning financial market. It represents the ease of buying and selling an asset without causing significant price fluctuations. In the realm of decentralized finance (DeFi), liquidity is particularly crucial for tokens, stablecoins, and Liquid-Staking Tokens (LSTs).

Lack of liquidity can cause large price swings and unfair trades. High liquidity, however, allows for larger trades without significantly affecting prices.

Stablecoins and LSTs are special cases of tokens that require high liquidity due to their inherent characteristics. Stablecoins, often regarded as the "cash" of the crypto world, need to be readily available and easily tradable, which is only achievable with abundant liquidity. LSTs, representing staked assets and their associated rewards, require liquidity to enable holders to access the underlying staked assets or trade their positions without causing significant price changes.

#### Liquidity Attraction

As stated above, it's crucial for a decentralized exchange (DEX) to attract liquidity.\
In this goal, have DEX has the possibility to reward LPs with native tokens, effectively boosting their yield and making the platform more attractive. This is called liquidity mining.

Here's the catch :  liquidity mining may be unhealthy to the native token price as LPs sell their rewarded tokens to realize the yield.

Maverick's tries to solve this problem in a novel way, by making incentives very efficient.\
