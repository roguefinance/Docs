#### Understanding the ve-Governance

In Maverick's voting-escrow model, token holders lock their **MAV** (from 1 week to 4 year), granting them voting power over **MAV** emissions and a share of platform fees. The magnitude of this voting power is proportional to the size and duration of their stake. The tokens remain locked until the previously choosen duration concludes.&#x20;

This mechanism is designed to prevent transient voting power from manipulating the governance process to the detriment of the protocol's users and community members.

#### The Emergence of Curve Wars and the Potential for LST Wars

The advent of the Curve Wars was fueled by Curve's vote-escrowed token (**veCRV**). The wars were a result of two innovations: Curve's novel stableswap pools, and the [voting-escrow](https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-vecrv.html) system, which provided a competitive mechanism for protocols seeking liquidity.

Maverick presents a similar set of conditions to ignite the LST Wars. Firstly, Maverick's dynamic distribution is tailor-made for LST pairs, much like stableswap was for stablecoins. Secondly, the **veMAV** system offers LST projects a fresh strategic option in their quest for liquidity.

#### veMAV's Role in Liquidity Provision and Boosted Positions

Maverick's governance mechanics should pique the interest of liquid staking protocols and other projects aiming to bootstrap liquidity, incentivize a price peg, or fulfill other needs for their tokens. As **veMAV** will be utilized to guide incentives in the AMM, it will play a pivotal role in attracting LPs to Boosted Positions and competing with other projects for liquidity.

Given the potential benefits, projects are likely to have a vested interest in collecting **veMAV** voting power. They may consider offering additional user incentives to holders to use their voting-escrow tokens in ways that benefit their project.

#### Maverick's Enhanced voting-escrow Model

Beyond Maverick's unique suitability for LST trading, the **veMAV** model offers a significant improvement over existing systems like Curve and Balancer. Usual voting-escrow systems do not allow protocols to target their voting power to a specific part of the AMM distribution, preventing them to deploy a whole set of interesting incentivization strategies.

#### SOS, Rogue!

However, once locked, **veMAV** tokens cannot be unlocked or transferred until the lock period ends. This creates an illiquid asset that, while providing voting power over Maverick AMM, limits the flexibility and ability to react to market changes.

Furthermore, liquidity providers would gain from having more stakes in Maverick's governance, allowing for straightforward access to enhanced rewards. This would lead to increased liquidity on Maverick, creating further benefits for the protocol.\
