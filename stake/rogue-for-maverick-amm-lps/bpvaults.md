### Boost your yield

Rogue _provides an optimized framework to interact with Maverick AMM._&#x20;

Rogue allows users to deposit their Maverick Boosted Position LP tokens (bpLPs) and reap the benefits of the ecosystem.\
As a Rogue user, you enjoy the same rewards you would obtain by staking LP tokens directly on Maverick: earn **MAV** emissions and earn extra incentive tokens rewarded in the Boosted-Position (**USH**, **LBR**..).

But with an added bonus! You get a pro-rata amount of **ROG** for every **MAV** claimed, significantly enhancing your earning potential.

The beauty of Rogue lies in its simplicity and added value - there's virtually no reason not to stake with us. By using Rogue, you not only partake in Maverick's rewards but also tap into the additional yield provided by **ROG** emissions.\
It's a win-win situation for DeFi enthusiasts looking for the best avenues to maximize their investments.

Rogue _unleashes more capital efficiency._

When you deposit their bpLP on Rogue, you receive an equivalent amount of shares from the vault. These shares can be used in a variety of ways, adding new layers of utility and efficiency to your capital.

{% hint style="success" %}
_bpLPs can be used as collateral in DeFi lending protocols by providing them as collateral to borrow assets or to supply and earn interests rates, thereby enhancing capital efficiency by giving access to leverage and further investment opportunities._&#x20;

**Keep it rogue**

In addition to staking your LPs, on Rogue, you can provide and remove liquidity from Maverick Boosted Positions. We're building a full interface.
