# Rogue for MAV lockers

Rogue rewards **MAV** lockers on the Rogue platform making it an ideal destination instead of going on Maverick. They receive liquid **rMAV** in return allowing anyone to further use or exit their staked position, while receiving multiple rewards:

* Get max boost voting power while remaining liquid
* Earn trading fees from Maverick's AMM in ETH (once and if fee switch is turned on)
* Earn a share of the **MAV** platform fees&#x20;
* Receive **ROG** rewards
* Get [bounties](../../earn/vote-market/#introducing-bounty) for voting
* Claim **veMAV** airdrops (to the best of our abilities)

(Soon: MAV lockers will share of Rogue's [OLM proceeds](broken-reference) in stablecoins)

Holders wishing to lock their **MAV** can just do it on [rogue.xyz](broken-reference).
