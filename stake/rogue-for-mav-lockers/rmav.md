# rMAV

#### Illiquidity issue

_veMAVs sit idle._

On Maverick, [**veMAV**](../../overview/maverick-amm/vemav.md#vemavs-role-in-liquidity-provision-and-boosted-positions) tokens are gained by locking **MAV**, Maverick's native token. However, once locked, these tokens cannot be unlocked or transferred until the lock period ends. This creates an illiquid asset that, while providing voting power and boosted LP yield on Maverick, limits the liquidity provider's flexibility and ability to react to market changes.

#### Liquify your votes

_Simply put: **rMAV** is liquid **veMAV**._

Rogue offers a solution to this limitation. When you lock **MAV** on Rogue, you receive **rMAV** at a 1:1 rate. **rMAV** tokens can be transferred, traded, or used as collateral in other DeFi protocols, creating new opportunities for yield and capital efficiency. You keep your voting power too (and the ability to delegate it).

_**rMAV** will be available in liquidity pools to exit a locked position._
{% endhint %}

By turning an illiquid asset into a liquid one, Rogue allows lockers to maintain their position and benefit Maverick while also having the flexibility to use that locked value elsewhere. This dramatically increases the capital efficiency of those "locked" funds, enabling them to be used in multiple ways rather than being stuck in a single position.

#### Earn the same rewards, plus more <a href="#cvxcrv-staking" id="cvxcrv-staking"></a>

**rMAV** can be staked on Rogue to receive the usual Maverick's protocol fees one would get for staking their rMAV on [mav.xyz](https://www.mav.xyz/). Additionally, users staking **rMAV** receive **MAV** rewards from Rogue performance fee, as well as the platform native token **ROG**.

Furthermore, rMAV voters will be eligible to [bounties](../../earn/vote-market/#introducing-bounty) (compensation from protocols interested in directing **veMAV** voting power) which significantly enhances **MAV** utility.

{% hint style="success" %}
_On Maverick, claiming fees gives back multiple tokens as rewards._\
_However on Rogue, all those fees are distributed in **ETH** to **rMAV** stakers, making it easier and cheaper to compound. Relax._
