# Go Rogue

### Rogue Protocol for Maverick AMM

Rogue Protocol offers an opportunity to acquire **veMAV** voting power without locking **MAV** yourself while providing Maverick's AMM LPs with boosted yields.

#### How we solve it

_Rogue provides an intertwined framework to interact with Maverick AMM_

Once locked, **veMAV** tokens cannot be unlocked or transferred until the lock period ends. The result is an illiquid asset that, while providing voting power limits the flexibility and ability to react to market changes.

Rogue solves this by giving you back a **veMAV** synthetic: Rogue-MAV ([**rMAV**](../stake/rogue-for-mav-lockers/rmav.md)**)** when you lock your **MAV** on [app.roguefinance.xyz](https://app.roguefinance.xyz). You are effectively keeping the perks of locking but can exit whenever you want.

#### Positive loop

First Rogue lower the barriers for users desiring to gain voting power on Maverick without the associated risks to lock an asset for a long period of time.

Rogue enhances yields for liquidity providers, drawing more capital into Maverick AMM's pools which effectively reduces [slippage](https://help.1inch.io/en/articles/4585109-what-is-price-impact-vs-price-slippage-in-defi). \
Better price quotes effectively makes Maverick AMM a more attractive platform for traders, especially those dealing with substantial volumes. \
This, in turn, generates more fees for liquidity providers, which will drive more LPs to deposit on Rogue.

#### Go Rogue
