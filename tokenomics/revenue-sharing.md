# üç∞ Fees & Revenue sharing

Rogue charges a 20% performance fee on **MAV** emissions claimed by LPs and **veMAV** fees generated**.**

#### Repartition of MAV claimed

* 80% goes to **bpLP** stakers: we aim to reward LP stakers for their fair share
* 10% goes to **eROG** holders in **gMAV**: this serves as [revenue share](revenue-sharing.md#revenue-share) (50% of platform fees)
* 5% goes to **rMAV** stakers: this rebalances lockers-LPs incentives
* 5% goes to Treasury: used to fund future protocol development

{% hint style="info" %}
_Note: Rogue only charges fees on MAV claimed, not on any extra incentive tokens._
{% endhint %}

#### Repartition of **veMAV** fees generated

* 80% goes to **rMAV** stakers
* 15% goes to **eROG** allocators: serves as [revenue share](revenue-sharing.md#revenue-share) (75% of platform fees)
* 5% goes to treasury: to fund future protocol development

There is also a 2% fee charged on [bounties deposits](../../guides/vote-market.md#introducing-bounty) of both MAV and ROG lockers. It is distributed to the Treasury.

## Revenue share

Rogue redistributes protocol fees to **eROG** allocators. When allocated to our Dividend Module, **eROG** gives access to a share of [performance fee](../../guides/platform-fees.md) it charges from [bpVaults](broken-reference) and [rMAV](broken-reference) holders rewards.

* _10% of all **MAV** claimed by LPs:_ These **MAV** are converted to **rMAV** before distribution to keep increasing the number of locked tokens.
* _15% of all fees claimed by **rMAV** stakers:_ These fees are converted to **ETH**, providing real yield in a well-established and widely-accepted asset.

This mechanism creates demand for **ROG** by making it a ticket to:&#x20;

* **rMAV**: earn voting power over a powerful liquidity mining program.
* **ETH**: earn a widely liquid yield-bearing asset.

(Soon: eROG holders share a portion of [Rogue OLM](broken-reference) proceeds)

Read about further **eROG** utility in the [next section](../../guides/vote-market.md).
